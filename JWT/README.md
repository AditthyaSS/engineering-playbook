## 📌 What is JWT?

**JWT (JSON Web Token)** is a compact, self-contained token used to **securely transmit information** between a client and a server.

In simple words:  
JWT is a **digital pass** that proves who you are, without asking you to log in again and again.

JWT is commonly used for **authentication and authorization**, especially in modern web applications and APIs, where the server does not maintain session state.
